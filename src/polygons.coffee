# This is a canvas toy which demonstrates hit detection for arbitrary
# polygons. Click anywhere to start creating a polygon. Click near the starting
# point to close it.
#
# Finished polygons are filled when the mouse cursor points at them. This is
# done using [Franklin's point in polygon algorithm][franklin].

#### Points, Polygons, and Lines

# A point is a pair of cartesian co-ordinates, `x` and `y`.
class Point
  constructor: (@x, @y) ->

  distanceTo: (p) ->
    return null unless p?
    dx = p.x - @x
    dy = p.y - @y
    Math.sqrt dx * dx + dy * dy

# Polygons are described by a list of points, or vertices.
class Polygon
  constructor: (@vertices) ->
    @closed = false
    @filled = false
    @colour = "hsl(0, 60%, 60%)"

  # This is the interesting bit. I should really describe how this works.
  contains: (point) ->
    return false unless @vertices.length > 0
    crossings = 0
    b = @vertices[@vertices.length - 1]
    for a in @vertices

      crossings++ if intersect && below

    crossings % 2 == 1

  # A polygon can draw itself into a canvas `context`.
  #
  # The polygon's outline is always drawn. If it is a closed polygon, a line is
  # drawn from its last vertex back to its first. If it is marked as filled,
  # the polygon has a translucent fill applied.

    context.stroke()
    context.globalAlpha = 0.5
    context.fill() if @filled

# Lines are described by two points, `start` and `end`.
class Line
  constructor: (@start, @end) ->

  # The line object can draw itself. This method is only used when selecting the
  # next vertex of an in-progress polygon; the other lines of the polygon are
  # drawn by the polygon itself.

#### Canvas and UI

# The user interface setup is handled in the window onload callback. This
# function closes over the state variables:
#
# * `canvas` is the canvas element we're drawing on, and `context` is its 2D
#   drawing context;
# * `polygon` is the polygon currently being drawn;
# * `line` is the extension line from the last vertex of `polygon` to the
#   cursor;
# * `polygons` is the collection of finished polygons.

  # relative to the `canvas` origin.

  # Append: add a new vertex to the polygon at the position of `e`.
  append = (e) ->

    # If the last point is at the same position as the first point, complete
    # the current polygon, choose a random colour, and add it to the list.

  # position at `e`. This indicates where the user's next click will add a
  # vertex.
